There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Code Friends ##
  
  > A collaborative text editor 

## Summary ##
  > Code Friends makes remote programming manageable for developers working on group projects by allowing them to pull projects from Github, collaborate in real-time on the same document, and then push the changes to Github 
  
## Problem ##
  > Programmers often need to edit code with remote partners (e.g., pair programming, code reviews, working through hard problems together, etc.). The current solutions allow one-sided screen sharing to view only one participant's files, but not concurrent editing

## Solution ##
  > Code Friends provides an environment for multiple people to view and edit the same document in real time via the browser

## Quote from You ##
  > "As developers we have constantly faced the problem of working on code with some one that is not in the office. We see Code Friends as a great way to solve this problem"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  1. Login via Github
  1. Clone your Github repo, add collaborators, and start editing withpeers (video, chat, or just editing)
  1. Push your edits back to Github

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I love Code Friends. Coding is finally fun again"
